# Phaser-Minesweeper ðŸ’£: A clone of the popular PC puzzle game

## **About the project** ðŸ’¬

### **_UI is pending, but I'll get to it soon!_**

The name of this project is pretty much self-explanatory. I started working on this in early-to-mid 2020 as a small challenge for myself, as I was starting to get into JavaScript coding at the time.

The code is written in the PhaserJS framework and there's some work left to do. Not too long until I get working on it, though (I'm really busy). The board and game logic is 100% working, so the UI is really the thing that is missing from the game.

### **How can I run/test/play it?**

You can either test an online work-in-progress version [here](https://smg5284.github.io/phaser-minesweeper/), or clone the repo and run the whole folder on an HTTP server. There's many alternatives, such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode or the [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) package offered with Python.
